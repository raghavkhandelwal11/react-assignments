    <h1>Do you know about SEO? does React.js supports SEO?</h1>
    <p>SEO stands for search engine optimization and it is a process of optimizing the visibiliy and recommendation of your website on the web. It is used by companies like google and bing in order to provide better react to the businesses connected with them</p>

    <p>Server side rendering in react may help website to get into easily readble formats by bots like Google's crawl bot. Although there is some skepticism in the react developer that Google's bot is not as much efficient as  reading the pages without javascript</p>

    <h1>Clean up in useEffect?</h1>
    <p>the useEffect cleanup function helps developers clean effects that  prevent unwanted behaviors and optimizes application performance.

        However, it is pertinent to note that the useEffect cleanup function does not only run when our component wants to unmount, it also runs right before the execution of the next scheduled effect.
        
        In fact, after our effect executes, the next scheduled effect is usually based on the dependency(array)

        <h1>What is the use of useCallback and useMemo?</h1>
        <p>Both are React Hooks for similiar purpose. useCallback can prevent the execution of the function with unessacery lengthy calculations. It does this by cacheing the last function call and if dependency values does not change it will give the same outpu with running the function again</p>

        <p>Similiar to useCallback, useMemo works by saving the previous return value and if the current input is same it will give the previous output simply without executing the function again</p>

        <h1>Why do we need keys in react?</h1>

        <p>A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.

        <h1>Do you kniw about redux?</h1>
        <p>Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state. React uses Redux for building the user interface. It was first introduced by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark in 2015.

            React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually simple. It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data which your component wants have changed, and re-renders your component.</p>
