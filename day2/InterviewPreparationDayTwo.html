    <h1>Difference between Stateful and Stateless components</h1>
    <p>
        A stateless component can render props, whereas a stateful component can render both props and state. A significant thing to note here is to comprehend the syntax distinction. In stateless components, the props are displayed like {props.name} but in stateful components, the props and state are rendered like {this.props.name} and {this.state.name} respectively. A stateless component renders output which depends upon props value, but a stateful component render depends upon the value of the state. A functional component is always a stateless component, but the class component can be stateless or stateful.
