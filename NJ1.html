    <h1>What is node.js?</h1>

    <p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p>

        What is NPM?
    </h1>

    <p>npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.</p>

    <p>We can use NPM to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.</li>
        <li>Download standalone tools you can use right away.</li>
        <li>Share code with any npm user, anywhere.</li>
        <li>Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
        </li>
        <li>Restrict code to specific developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What are modules in Node.js?</h1>

    <p>In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality. Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders. The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their re-usability as well as the ability to break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks</p>

    <h1>What is the purpose of modules.export?</h1>

    <p>By using modules.exports we can export the function and objects as named or default exports, so that if these are required anywhere we can import them and use them in other files or components</p>

    <h1>Differnce Between named and default export?</h1>
    <p>Named exports are way of exporting the objects by some specific name, while importing we need to mention their exact name to get them.</p>
    <p>Default export are easier to work with as there is no specific name required to access while importing the files. we can directly import them using any name and use them</p>

    <h1>How do you import any module in Node.js?</h1>
