    <h1>What are events in react?</h1>
    <p>An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user action or system generated event. For example, a mouse click, loading of a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, and other interactions are called events.

        React has its own event handling system which is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. The react event handling system is known as Synthetic Events. The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event.</p>

        <h1>What is memory leak and how to overcome?</h1>

        <p>Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget to delete it. 

            The consequences of memory leak is that it reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory. Eventually, in the worst case, too much of the available memory may become allocated and all or part of the system or device stops working correctly, the application fails, or the system slows down vastly</p>

            <p>To avoid memory leaks, memory allocated on heap should always be freed when no longer needed.</p>

            <h1>Do you prefer function-based or class component and why?</h1>
            <p>Generally developers prefers functional components as they require lesser code and can replicated almost all the featues of a class component</p>

            <h1>Explain reducer as a pure function in redux?</h1>

            <p>
                if we carefully see the reducer function, it only takes state and action as an input parameters and it return the modified state object only on basis of its own previous state values, there are no other outer dependencies to influence the reducer function's output, so that's why it acts as a pure function.

            <h1>Why do we use redux thunk?</h1>
            <p>Redux supports middleware, and middleware functions run between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. Redux middlewares can be used for logging, routing, asynchronous actions, etc.

            Redux middleware called thunk allows us to return functions instead of objects from redux actions. Plain redux doesnâ€™t allow complex logic inside action functions</p>

            <h1>What do you know about NPM?</h1>
            <p>npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

                The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.
                
                Open-source developers use npm to share software.
                
                Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.</p>
